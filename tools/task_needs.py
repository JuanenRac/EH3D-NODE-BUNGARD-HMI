# EH3D-NODE-BUNGARD-HMI - what each FreeRTOS task of the firmware needs at least (tools/check_firmware_defaults.py reads it; a task that is not here fails the check).
# Every number is the size it has now or more: shrinking one has to be a decision, not an accident. They were not measured on a module yet: the firmware logs the stack each task has
# left (main/app_main.cpp) so these numbers can be tightened or raised after a run on the board.
