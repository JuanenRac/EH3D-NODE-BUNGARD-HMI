// What the screen says when a program of the job ends, and the words about the bar of the tool changer. A drilling that ends with a routing still to come is a STAGE: its own
// notice (a spoken `stage.wav`, or a tone) and a window that says the routing comes next, with the buttons to follow it or to stop; it is not the end of the job, so the sound of
// the end and the order to take the board out wait until the whole job is done. The decision is made here from two numbers of the workflow, so it is tested on a computer.
