// The flow of a job between the screen, the server, the node and the desktop programs, as the screen sees it: a file of the card is chosen,
// sent to the server (which plans it and keeps it READY; nothing starts by itself), started by the operator through the gate, followed
// in the fleet as it runs (the desktop programs see the same job at the same time), and answered when it waits for the operator at a tool
// change. A job that was stopped goes on from the holes (or paths) already done, and a drilling file and a routing file chosen together run one after the other.
// Every step is a request to the server or a reading of its answer, so the flow is tested without a server.
