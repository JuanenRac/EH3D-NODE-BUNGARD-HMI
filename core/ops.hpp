// EH3D-NODE-BUNGARD-HMI - core/ops.hpp: the orders of the screen as an enum, not as text.

//
// A button of the screen used to say what it asks with a text (`"pause"`, `"start job"`) that the application compared again to know what to send to the server: a text that is
// changed in one place and not in the other is an order that does nothing. Every order the screen sends is now an `Op`; the text (`op_id`) stays as the id the confirmation shows and
// the voice uses, and `op_of` reads it back, so the two cannot drift: a test goes through the whole table.
