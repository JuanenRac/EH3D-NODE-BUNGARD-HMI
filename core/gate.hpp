// The gate between what the operator asks (a touch or a spoken order) and what the screen sends to the machine.
//
// The rules, all of them tested on the host:
//  * a stop is never held back: from a touch or from the voice, in any state, it goes at once;
//  * the hardware stop is a latch the screen cannot clear by itself: while the input is pressed, or until the operator has
//    acknowledged its release on the screen, no move and no spindle order passes;
//  * a move or a spindle order passes only when the link is armed, and (unless the bench setting turns it off for the touch) it first asks for a
//    confirmation that lives `confirm_timeout_ms`; a spoken order always asks, whatever the setting says;
//  * a spoken "yes" confirms only when the setting `voice_confirm` is on; by default only a touch on the screen does;
//  * a new request drops the one that waited, and a lost link drops it too.
