// The gate between what the operator asks (a touch or a spoken order) and what the screen sends to the machine.
//
// The rules, all of them tested on the host:
//  * a stop is never held back: from a touch or from the voice, in any state, it goes at once; so is a pause, which only holds the job;
//  * the press of the hardware stop is an edge the application takes once, to stop the job of the machine on the server;
//  * the start of a job that is ready asks like a move, but it does not need the link to be armed (a job is armed only once it runs);
//  * the hardware stop is a latch the screen cannot clear by itself: while the input is pressed, or until the operator has
//    acknowledged its release on the screen, no move and no spindle order passes;
//  * a move or a spindle order passes only when the link is armed, and (unless the bench setting turns it off for the touch) it first asks for a
//    confirmation that lives `confirm_timeout_ms`; a spoken order always asks, whatever the setting says;
//  * a spoken "yes" confirms only when the setting `voice_confirm` is on; by default only a touch on the screen does;
//  * a spindle order never asks for more turns than the spindle gives (the setting `spindle_max_rpm` and the top speed of the spindle the server says the machine carries,
//    whichever is lower): with `spindle_over = clip` (the default) the order is cut to that speed and the screen says so, with `refuse` it is refused; the confirmation
//    always shows the turns the spindle will really get;
//  * a new request drops the one that waited, and a lost link drops it too.
